# What's this?
This is a hand-rolled implementation of Base 64 Encoding with URL and Filename
Safe Alphabet as defined in [Section
5](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4648#section-5) of IETF RFC 4648.

## Why would you hand-roll something like that?
Certainly not because I am smarter than any of the authors of already existing
implementations.

The reason why I have done this is simply learning. I have been using Base64
encoding forever, but never looked into the nuances of how it is actually
implemented or the history behind it. So, better late than never, as they say.
